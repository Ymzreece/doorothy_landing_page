You are building a complete landing page in JavaScript, structured so that the output can be uploaded and used on Wix.com (Wix Custom Code / Wix Velo compatible).
You must output a fully working single-page landing site, including HTML structure, CSS styling, and JS logic, all in one deliverable.

The product is a door opener called Doorothy, under the brand ABITAT.

Your task:
Generate the full landing page code (HTML + CSS + JS) with placeholder assets and layout, following all requirements below.

	•	Lying in bed → press button → door closes
	•	During meetings/phone calls → press button to close door
